# Weather-App
Weather Application using HTML/CSS and JavaScript which fetches real-time weather conditions from cities all around the world.

## How It Works: 
The web application fetches weather conditions using the Current Weather Data API from OpenWeatherMap.org. The front-end consists of HTML and CSS while JavaScript fetches the JSON data using JQuery. Images are retrieved from unsplash which alters the background image in relation to the city searched. **#NOTE#** ***API has been depreciated so weather results may not be accurate.***
